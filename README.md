# CODE-Shopping-Cart-LeiyiYu
OpenTable Summer Internship Test

Programming with C++

Files: Shopcart.cpp shopcart.exe

I successfully achieved the basic requirements of this assignment in two hours. And I did some modularization of my code to make it clear. I also use a struct to store the numbers of different items.

1. Initialize the number of items
2. Get input string
3. Scan input string
4. Calculate total price with consideration of discounts
5. Output total price

I think there are some aspects that the work can be improved.

1. Check if the input string is valid. Because customers may enter invalid item names and the system can't recognize them. A warning sentence should be added.
2. Encapsulation can be applied by adding some classes and files if the project is large.
